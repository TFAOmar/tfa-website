              Your Financial Rubik's Cube, Solved
            </h2>
            
            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-muted-foreground space-y-6">
              <p>
                Every client comes to me with their own version of a Rubik's Cube—a unique 
                set of financial questions and concerns that need solving. My job is to 
                understand what's important to you and why, then build a strategy that 
                prioritizes your goals. I don't take a one-size-fits-all approach, and I'm 
                not here to push products or services you don't need. Clients appreciate 
                that I take the time to listen first and recommend second.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-8">My Communication Philosophy</h3>
              <p>
                My mother's first language is Spanish, and English is her second language. 
                This shapes how I work with every client. I treat everyone like finance is 
                their second language—because for most people, it is. I approach every 
                conversation with the same patience and empathy I hope others show my mother. 
                I keep things simple, explain concepts multiple ways until you understand, 
                and never make you feel rushed for asking questions.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-8">My Foundation</h3>
              <p>
                I'm a financial advisor at Infinite Wealth Management (a sister company to 
                Infinite Insurance & Financial Services), based in La Mirada, CA. I've built 
                my practice entirely through word of mouth and client referrals. I maintain 
                strong relationships with partners like The Financial Architects, which allows 
                me to provide comprehensive solutions for my clients. A significant part of my 
                practice focuses on serving federal employees, particularly USPS workers, 
                helping them maximize their unique benefits and retirement systems.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-8">Finding the Right Fit</h3>
              <p>
                I'm a great fit if you don't enjoy managing your own accounts, you're concerned 
                your risk doesn't align with your strategy, you want to reduce taxes, or you're 
                curious about your fees. I work well with people who want a knowledgeable 
                professional versed in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, annuities, and both 
                types of life insurance—without product pushing. If you've had a frustrating 
                experience previously, I'd welcome the chance to show you a different approach.
              </p>

              <p>
                I was born in Bellflower, grew up in Long Beach, and now call Artesia home 
                with my wife Fabiola (Fabi) and our four kids: Leslie, Aylin, Erik Jr, and Eli. 
                One thing I genuinely appreciate about where we live is being able to walk to 
                shops, restaurants, and the mall. It fits our family perfectly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fabi has a gift for keeping me centered on life's priorities. My children are 
                actually why I walked away from corporate work years back. I wanted them to 
                grow up with experiences and opportunities that create a rich life. Today, our 
                family's largest annual investment goes toward travel and building memories together.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I'm not working, you'll find me tackling home improvement projects or 
                handling basic maintenance on our cars, like oil and brake work. Honestly, 
                walking through Home Depot feels like being in a toy store! At the core, I'm 
                driven by a simple belief: life is meant for enjoying and building lasting 
                memories with those you cherish most.
